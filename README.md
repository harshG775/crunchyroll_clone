# React + Vite and Node.js Server



some changes
This project is a full-stack application that combines a React frontend built with Vite and a Node.js server for backend functionality.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the server and client parts of the project.

### Run the Server

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Run the server in development mode:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   The server will start at the specified port, and you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Run the Client

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Run the client in development mode:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   The client will start, and you can view it in your browser at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## Project Structure

- **Server (`server/`):**
  - The `server` directory contains the Node.js server code.
  - Configuration files, routes, controllers, and other backend-related code reside here.

- **Client (`client/`):**
  - The `client` directory contains the React frontend code built with Vite.
  - React components, services, and other frontend-related code reside here.

## Development

During development, both the server and client will automatically reload when changes are made to the source code.
